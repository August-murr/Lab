# Welcome to My AI Kindergarten

Welcome to my AI kindergarten where I aim to nurture and develop little AI's in a safe and caring environment, preparing them for the real world.

This lab is a place of continuous experimentation and research, with the ultimate goal of training AI's to be self-sufficient, capable of independent interaction with the world, exploration, and learning from their actions. I strive to create safe, trustworthy AI companions that can operate with minimal human input.

Depending on when you're looking at this repository, you may notice that it is in different stages of development. To make things simpler, I will break down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable pieces. This will help us to develop more efficient and complete workflows gradually.

At every step of the way, I'll provide detailed explanations and notes, communicated through blogs and markdowns.
